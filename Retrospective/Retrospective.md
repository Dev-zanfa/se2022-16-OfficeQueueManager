## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: 2 out of 3
- Total points committed vs. done: 19 committed and 16 done
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): 56 planned and 59h15m

A story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   | 5   | - | 19 | 22.75 |
| _#1_   |    3     |   13    |     11       |       10       |

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual): avg: 4,73, standard deviation: 1.9
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1: -0.12 (12%)

## ASSESSMENT

- _What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?_ 

Unexperienced in organization and team coordination.

- _What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?_

Team coordination and planning
  
- _Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)_

Better planning on story points and time estimations.
Better task division and distribution.

- _One thing you are proud of as a Team!!_

We worked well together and successfully delivered a working application.
