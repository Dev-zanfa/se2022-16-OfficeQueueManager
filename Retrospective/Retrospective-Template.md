TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team ##)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: 2 out of 3
- Total points committed vs. done: 19 committed and 16 done
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): 56 planned and 57.5

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#1_   |    3     |   13    |     11       |       10       |

| uncategorized | 5   | ## | 19 | 22.75 |
   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual): avg: 4,73, standard deviation: 1.9
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1: -0.12 (12%)

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 2h
  - Total hours spent: 2h
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 16 tests
  - Coverage (if available): 82%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 2h
  - Total hours spent: 1h
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 2h
  - Total hours spent: 4h
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)? 

Unexperienced in organization and team coordination.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

Team coordination and planning
- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

Planning on story points and time estimations, better task division and distribution.

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

We worked well together and successfully delivered a working application.
